            Challenges Faced by Businesses
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            The challenge for many businesses looking to build an online store
            is the complexity of the process. For small to medium-sized
            businesses, the cost and technical expertise required to launch an
            e-commerce website can be overwhelming. Many business owners have
            limited experience with web development, making it difficult to
            achieve the desired look and functionality for their online store.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            Additionally, as businesses grow, they often face challenges related
            to scalability, such as slow website performance during peak
            traffic, payment processing issues, and difficulty managing a large
            number of products and customers.

            One of the standout features of WebMaster is its scalability. The
            platform uses cloud-based infrastructure, ensuring that your online

            remains fast and reliable.

            helps business owners track sales, monitor customer behavior, and
            make data-driven decisions. With these insights, business owners can
            continuously improve their stores to boost conversions and sales.
